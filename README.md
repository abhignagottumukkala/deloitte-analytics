Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Experience â€“ Forage
This repository contains my submission for the Deloitte Australia Data Analytics virtual experience offered by Forage. The experience involved solving real-world data challenges using Tableau and Excel, mimicking the work of a Deloitte analyst.


Objectives:
Explore and clean forensic data to identify suspicious activity.
Use Excel for initial classification and logic-based filtering.
Create a compelling Tableau dashboard to communicate findings.
Apply analytical thinking to solve a simulated client problem.
